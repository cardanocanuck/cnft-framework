# CNFT Framework

This is a Cardano NFT framework used to generate NFT's, upload NFTS, mint and send them over Cardano network, an API for the high-demand sale event.

## It's scope

The cworker's responsibility is to automate the actions required to happen on the Cardano Blockchain.

- Receive the payment
- Record the payment is received
- Mint a token and send a response to the original payment sender
- Record the minting and a response were succesfully sent

## Extended scope

There are lots of useful scripts residing in tools folder that can be helpful to mass-generate X amount of tokens and upload them to IPFS

## Dirty

This project is not properly cleaned up.

It is a proven platform that was used by CryptoDoggies, if you're an experienced developer using it may save you weeks of time.
In this case, do not hesitate to do merge requests as you go through and generalize it to fit all sort of CNFT projects.
